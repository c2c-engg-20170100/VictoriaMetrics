**Answers from different channel to configure Prometheus with VictoriaMetrics**  
  
Visit http://<**serverB**>:9090/config and make sure it contains all the scrape_configs and all remote_write config  
2. Visit http://<**serverB**>:9090/targets and make sure it contains all the scrape targets mentioned in the Prometheus config and they are healthy (i.e. Unhealthy tab has zero targets).  
3. Inspect Prometheus logs for errors - see https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/prometheus-users/tL9Rh-TKeRA   
4. Inspect VictoriaMetrics logs for errors.  
5. Navigate to http://<**serverB**>:9090/metrics and check metric values starting from prometheus_remote_storage . Make sure prometheus_remote_storage_succeeded_samples_total increases while prometheus_remote_storage_failed_samples_total remains constant over time.  
6. Navigate to http://<**serverA**>:8428/metrics and make sure vm_rows_inserted_total increases while vm_read_errors_total remains constant over time.

Hi @Apurva Dhoble!  
To verify that Prometheus actually sends data to remote storage you need to check it's metrics.  
Pls navigate to `http://<prometheus-addr>/metrics` and look for metrics with prefix `prometheus_remote_storage`.  
Or query these metrics from the graph page at `http://<prometheus-addr>/graph` by executing following query:  
`{__name__=~"prometheus_remote_storage.*"}`  
The metrics names are pretty self-describing and it would be easy to understand what is the state of writing into remote storage.  
  
To verify that VictoriaMetrics accepts writes from Prometheus navigate to `http://<victoriametrics-addr>/metrics` and look for following metrics:  

    vm_rows_inserted_total{type="prometheus"}  
    vm_http_requests_total{path="/api/v1/write", protocol="prometheus"}  
    vm_read_calls_total{name="prometheus"}  

If VictoriaMetrics accepts writes those metrics should have values greater than 0.  
  
VictoriMetrics path to storage is configured vai flag `storageDataPath`. You may also find it's value in `http://<victoriametrics-addr>/metrics`. Are you able to query any data from VictoriaMetrics?

Question:  hi, i have setup victoria metrics on a single node, and able to see metrics belonging to that host on path  `:8248/metrics` . I have added remote_write  and passed victoria single node hostname in prometheus template and did a restart on promtheus, but i still see only local metrics on 8248, none of the metrics which are available on promtheus are not available here, can someone assist me on this ?  
  
Answer:  `/metrics` page exposes only internal metrics from VictoriaMetrics. These metrics can be scraped by Prometheus and later analyzed via official Grafana dashboard for VictoriaMetrics. See https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/blob/master/README.md#monitoring for details.  
All the metrics received by VictoriaMetrics from third-party clients are exposed via Prometheus querying API - see https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/api/  or via `/api/v1/export` handler. See https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/blob/master/README.md#how-to-export-time-series
i can see metrics now  by this`/api/v1/export?match[]={job=}`
